# docpad

You want docpad v6.78.6

I canâ€™t get this and the plugins to install using `npm i` or `docpad install`

Might work if shift to older node version.

I can get this to work if I copy a working `./www-slides/node_modules/` folder from another place.

The same  `./www-slides/node_modules/` folder works on brittle (mac os) and hp-g6 (ubuntu under WSL); in the past, copying this folder to masala (mac os) did not work. But I was able to `npm i` on masala, so who knows?
