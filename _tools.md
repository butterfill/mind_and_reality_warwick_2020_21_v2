# screen recordings

- windows tablet
- epic pen
- sharex

did try all kinds of ways with OBS (maxes out GPU, barely functions),
edge browser annotations (cannot smoothly annotate and then click link),
and smoothdraw (using colour key in OBS to make it appear over web page, 
but cannot then click links).


## sharex config

You have to search under the settings menus for the ffmpeg page and then enable the microphone source
(doesnâ€™t seem to remember settings between reboots for me)
