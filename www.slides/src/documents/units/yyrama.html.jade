description: """
  The most important work on this course, apart from the exams, is the weekly seminar tasks.
  You need to submit some work before your seminar each week.
  This mostly involves writing, or re-writing, a mini essay as well as peer-reviewing another
  studentâ€™s work.
  The seminars exist for you to discuss your writing.
