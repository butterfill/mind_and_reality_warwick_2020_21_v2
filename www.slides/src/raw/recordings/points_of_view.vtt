Welcome to this course on mind
and reality. I'm Steve

Butterfill and I'll be your
lecturer for this course.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.926
I haven’t taught this course before.
It's the first time for me,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8743811

0b9fa041-de69-4098-808d-0097cfe9fe02
00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:15.694
so it's particularly
exciting. It's also

00:00:15.694 --> 00:00:18.808
the first time that I've
taught an online lecture

And weirdly enough, I'm
incredibly nervous.

00:00:30.637 --> 00:00:35.096
course about the notion of a
point of view. A point of view

To illustrate, in the novel ‘The Lost
Memory of Skin‘,

extraordinary. He creates

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.102
How does he do that? He allows
you to understand the world or

point of view.

This is a feature of many novels
and of course plenty of fact

example. They allow you to
understand things from another,

perhaps quite alien POV.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.692
Why am I even mentioning this
obvious truth? Well, you and I

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.245
And having a point of view is a
fundamental part of having a

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:29.025
mind like mine or yours. So
thinking about points of view on

dbc6fd85-b9ea-4a4a-8cc0-111ccdc02ee1

the world seems to me like a
good place to start in a course

called mind and reality.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.466
So point of view, very simple.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.597
There are some things which
are presented to you in a

certain way. Having a point

d2ac4df0-2018-4f6c-bfc9-b80ba1085714

matter of there being some
things which are presented

Terminology, though can get

00:01:53.602 --> 00:01:57.932
pretty confusing. So as well as
talking about points of view,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8368693

fefe8d69-df48-49ef-a16e-6312d991d23a
00:01:57.932 --> 00:01:59.522
I'll follow other people in

039e2e9b-7ed1-4adf-ae22-2afc4e748a80
00:01:59.522 --> 00:02:03.453
talking about perspectives. But
when I say perspective, I just

00:02:03.453 --> 00:02:07.521
mean a point of view of
perspective on the world is a

51ceb614-9aca-46c3-9079-0fc767b11f84
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:11.250
point of view on the world,
another piece of terminology? Is

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.640
this term intentionality? Now
that's another term I'm going to

NOTE Confidence: 0.86643994

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.708
use very much, but you'll see it
used quite widely in the

32fa35c1-0d0c-4844-9b42-0516d26b923b
00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:22.437
textbooks. Intentionality is a
feature of you or some states or

NOTE Confidence: 0.86643994

9568838d-b606-4510-8f62-dbf5a4b0e49c
00:02:22.437 --> 00:02:25.488
some other kind of part or
aspect of you.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.382
In virtue of which you have a
point of view, so we're talking

00:02:30.382 --> 00:02:33.208
about intentionality. Were just
talking about that in which.

d84dafc6-a4ee-449c-a09e-4f107f42ac39
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.614
Sorry, say that again when
we're talking about

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:39.158
intentionality, we just
talking about that in virtue

of which you have a point of
view.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.002
So this is of course as I say
about points of view about the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8849087

c0ba6c64-f6d9-430d-80ef-991860632f9c
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:50.291
idea that there are some things
which are presented to you in a

f8e72b23-107a-4b47-886b-36cafdf1f37b
00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:53.580
certain way. For me those may be
presented in a different way, or

NOTE Confidence: 0.8849087

e8f58461-654e-44cf-8197-2e944abfc75a
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.363
maybe that those things are not
presented to me at all.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.740
Now, the notion of a point of
view is going to turn out to be

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.560
extremely puzzling, so it's
helpful to think at first about

NOTE Confidence: 0.8296404

a066229a-279e-4251-ac77-032ad7c6da9a
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.998
a much simpler notion. The
notion of a viewpoint.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88368714

5dba8afc-c51a-4bbd-af88-7b523611be05
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.302
A viewpoint is just a location
in space and a direction.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.264
I can occupy viewpoint and so
can you, but of course you don't

0d87ab40-3828-4767-9d94-b4678bde7692
00:03:20.264 --> 00:03:22.968
have to have a mind to occupy a

85bc50ef-85a4-43b1-aedf-8c632684bca9
00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:26.180
viewpoint. A rock can also
occupy viewpoint. Now this is

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.080
tricky because rocks,
unlike you and I, don't have

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.270
fronts and backs.  They
don't have faces, but we could

e6398864-549e-4eb5-9f05-b307a9534ba4
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.750
mark the front over otg with
some paint. Or we could have

5a172262-f377-4866-8c5e-0080171baadd
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.230
assigned some functions of the
rock that gave it a front like

we do with cars and chairs, and
the rest these were all funded

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.770
objects. Once we come the rocker
front there is a sense in which

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.960
the rock is occupying a
viewpoint and you might have to

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.440
move the Rourke in order for you
to occupy the viewpoints that

2c8d0cf9-0002-42fd-99ad-31ca03fd1fb1
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.855
previously the Rourke. Was

00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:59.460
occupying. So nice to viewpoint
is an UN. Mysterious notion is

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.776
just a location and a direction,
but it seems to be related to

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:06.100
the idea of a point of view.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.468
So we might ask.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.491
Is having a point of view just a
matter of occupying a viewpoint?

eec265d9-a8b3-4937-9aa3-ec98953fb76e
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.988
The idea that something with the
mind might have a point of view

00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:24.024
is going to turn out to be
extremely puzzling. That's what

eaa06fab-fe5b-42c5-b8ad-e6c7ef171294

By contrast, the idea that
something occupies the viewpoint

is not puzzling at all. 
You can do that. I can do

8dad65c9-e5eb-4033-8db9-1ea184840503
00:04:31.144 --> 00:04:32.386
that. Rocks can do that very
