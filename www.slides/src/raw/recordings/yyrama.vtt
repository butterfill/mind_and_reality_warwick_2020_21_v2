00:00:05.224 --> 00:00:09.568
the most important work that you
will do on the course of

ce729f34-2273-435e-8ae0-a38ebac6e8dc

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.462
Every week you're going to write
something and submit it to your

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.220
This is very important. Sharing
your writing with your seminar

expressing and defending them.

sense of how hopefully things
are improving as you go through

because the seminars for this

00:00:54.494 --> 00:00:58.076
The seminars are really about
you being interrogated by

The third component of our
seminar work is the peer review.

that will be available for

This is a very important part of
your learning. Sometimes people

00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:48.908

of that is peer review. When I

this morning. That piece of work
is subject to peer review. Of

learn to improve my work. It's
