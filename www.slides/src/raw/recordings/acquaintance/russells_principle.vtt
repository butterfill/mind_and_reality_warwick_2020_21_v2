So welcome to lecture two of
mind and reality.

miss with the online lectures?

some substitute for that.

Anyway, here's lecture 2. We're
going to start by thinking about

Russell's principle of
acquaintance. The question that

00:00:24.878 --> 00:00:28.479
we are concerned with for this
part of the course. One of our

ee1c1dfe-3bb7-4ad5-9b93-01fad59b9f14

seven questions is how do our
thoughts connect to the things

7a841ba6-8662-4601-aa15-d3deca5f0df3
00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:32.634
about which we think?

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.684
When I say think here, I mean
that in a very broad sense. So

2b63db24-4efe-4f9c-b1f0-d9f7997f7081
00:00:37.684 --> 00:00:40.830
if you are, for example,
frightened that a Tiger is about

0960fedd-7659-4884-a844-3814f9ac8abc

to bite you in being frightened,
you're thinking about the Tiger.

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.836
Likewise, once the Tiger has
bitten you, let's say, and

00:00:46.836 --> 00:00:49.696
you're angry now with the Tiger
for biting bad Tiger.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.132
In anger, you are thinking about
the Tiger. In this process of

thing. So, so we're using the

the Tiger as you are. If you

Tiger, you believe that the
Tiger only bit you because it

you may know that although the

take this question here. This

isn't quite the question that I
want to address, so I want to

00:01:48.772 --> 00:01:51.182
just give this a slight twist.
It's something very closely

related and that will help us so
we can ask instead of that first

00:01:54.556 --> 00:01:58.256
question, we can say. What sort
of relation between a subject

00:01:58.256 --> 00:02:02.260
and an object has to obtain? If
the subject is able to think

b272ec3a-c8b8-4c77-bf18-5cb017d7c7db
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.780
about the object? Yeah, makes

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.484
sense. OK, so here's the
question. We're going to focus

NOTE Confidence: 0.852237403392792

e4f75fc8-2f05-4dee-a52b-40882267ec8e
00:02:08.484 --> 00:02:11.682
on and the idea here is that the
subject is just that which

NOTE Confidence: 0.852237403392792

8cb052a1-7fe4-4fcb-b63b-3037ee47ed47
00:02:11.682 --> 00:02:14.634
thinks. So if you have a
thought, you were the subject of

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:17.586
that thought. When I have a
thought on the subject of their

thought, if the Tigers thinking
gosh, you know, I really wish I

hadn't been her. The Tiger is
the subject of the thought,

00:02:23.244 --> 00:02:26.196
right? I don't know why the
Tiger wood would think that, but

7c241d40-9acd-4e73-bca4-60b2e7fd4bc4
00:02:26.196 --> 00:02:28.202
maybe it does anyway. There we

go. The answer that we are
interested in is given to us by

that the relation in question is

one of acquaintance. What
relates you to the things that

for example, is that relation
acquaintance? It's your

enables you to have thoughts

about the Tiger. This of course
raises the interesting question

that's wrong. Anyway, I bear
some relation spatial relation
