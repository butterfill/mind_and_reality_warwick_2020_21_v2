5c65e634-4611-4c01-9983-d8a355413a67
00:05:45.922 --> 00:05:49.288
by description, whether or not
we're acquainted with the

NOTE Confidence: 0.86401695

1dd442c5-3e49-4800-906f-dd2445481ed3
00:05:49.288 --> 00:05:51.906
object. So here's Russell
explaining the notion.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8701682

eb537548-09b3-4760-88bd-537430f7599c
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.380
Of knowledge by description,
this is what Russell has in mind

NOTE Confidence: 0.8701682

ca29be27-8dad-4899-8446-893706c9f51b
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.740
for knowledge by description.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8355832

5a9f42f5-622b-400e-a971-238366ed7db8
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.724
So if you're ever wondering to
yourself, you know, gosh, what

NOTE Confidence: 0.8355832

2d4e6c09-c7f4-4e6f-9c31-b060923f5257
00:06:03.724 --> 00:06:06.964
is this knowledge by description
business? This is the answer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8355832

2d6cce94-3fe3-43ec-a692-dcceb98f9251
00:06:06.964 --> 00:06:10.528
This is the answer. That's what
Russell says about knowledge by

NOTE Confidence: 0.85729706

22122a20-f4d4-4cf1-92b3-55b6e705f740
00:06:10.528 --> 00:06:14.884
description. And as I said,
that's contrasted with the

NOTE Confidence: 0.85729706

251f8fed-b068-4622-9197-c9c87132c558
00:06:14.884 --> 00:06:19.042
notion of acquaintance. So it's
possible for you to think about

NOTE Confidence: 0.85729706

0c51c650-aa3d-4bdb-aab2-1c462f00f002
00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:22.066
things, either because you're
acquainted with them or.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84732974

752fcd41-86fb-40f2-8109-a07d169754f3
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.630
Be cause. You have knowledge by
description of them, but those

NOTE Confidence: 0.84732974

efe15eb1-b35b-45b0-a865-a6ad71b38c50
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.430
two things are supposed to be
related. You see, acquaintance

969aca6a-7df9-49c4-a7d6-bc9d7a23b2b4
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.110
is supposed to be the more

62558663-df3e-40be-a8fb-3d0480da2df4
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.025
fundamental thing. And the
description stuff essentially

5c1bae3e-9379-436b-a562-38e82318f78b
00:06:34.025 --> 00:06:36.849
is supposed to kind of
leverage your knowledge.

d7bee616-f203-4a62-988e-3974b6c701fd
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.650
Your acquaintance sorry. Let me
say that one more time the

acquaintance is supposed to be,
the more fundamental thing.

7d8eee23-d073-4850-ab77-3b09cd0c9a26
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.684
Knowledge by description
essentially supposed to

d34b5819-bd50-40ee-a7f0-bec1923502bd
00:06:46.684 --> 00:06:49.150
provide a way of kind of
leveraging your acquaintance

NOTE Confidence: 0.8108358

9a6b8c5c-c85c-4ed7-9d37-6f4d2d7172d3
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.438
to enable you to think about a
wider set of things. That's

NOTE Confidence: 0.8108358

558bfd86-aa1a-4560-978d-133066e6312d
00:06:52.438 --> 00:06:55.452
that's the idea that Russell
has, and that's why all of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8108358

e2b3be54-3361-4183-a5cf-8201439c2976
00:06:55.452 --> 00:06:57.918
this turns out to be
compatible with the principle

00:06:57.918 --> 00:06:58.466
of acquaintance.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8510408

731c83a2-1525-436c-bf80-5d7c15dbfa5f
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.608
That's right. What was wrong
with this objection? That's a

2dcdc001-46bd-4091-b76b-61b3683faf7a
00:07:05.608 --> 00:07:08.589
good reply to the objection from
Julius Caesar. What was wrong

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:11.028
with this objection? That's
actually a very good question.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8510408

07c296f5-61aa-4178-985b-eba52acdb099
00:07:11.028 --> 00:07:14.280
Why don't you turn to the people
that you're watching this with?

e5d08766-38e3-4f5c-8d48-bb5a9791cfac
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.532
I hope you're watching it with
some people. If you are, that's

how you work best in 90 seconds.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.048
What is wrong with this
objection to Russell's

NOTE Confidence: 0.833402

4bd7dcd0-b875-44bf-ad6c-c6beb4ff11ea
00:07:24.048 --> 00:07:28.958
principle of acquaintance whi?
Is this not actually a good

NOTE Confidence: 0.833402

5e4b2e18-cda3-4c61-a180-e6cfecdea107
00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:33.377
objection even though it
should seem like 190 seconds

NOTE Confidence: 0.833402

1446ceb4-11ea-486c-a7c1-97eb4d7ed7d5

go?

cfdaef4e-369e-4381-9483-cd2dfb22911b
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:09.010
So why is this apparently but
not actually a good objection to

NOTE Confidence: 0.85954064

97002076-ac00-44cd-99b5-ee72645a4bb7
00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.375
Russell's principle of

NOTE Confidence: 0.92128146

15d8f87b-c24b-4e61-a3ee-df7252081fcd
00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:13.290
acquaintance? Well,
here's what I think.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8480097

2be4b647-217f-48a4-ab0a-54910d054888
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:18.190
What we gotta do is reject the
idea that the third thing

NOTE Confidence: 0.8480097

97669b8d-fa2b-4aa6-bc58-ac0371d0c622
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.490
follows from the first 2, so
we're not rejecting the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.8480097

85d070ed-e454-432a-8e9f-15b6fd235336
00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.190
thing. We're not rejecting the
second thing. We're accepting.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8480097

77405c29-de63-4d29-a777-d1ae385ddfbf
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.490
Both of those were embracing
them. We were saying that the

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.790
third thing doesn't follow from
the first 2. One is that.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.200
It's big cause the principle
acquaintance doesn't really say

0dfbb460-aadd-4619-bb8b-73a97b674c2a
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.280
you can only think about things
with which you're acquainted. I

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.920
like that as a first draft. It's
kind of simple, right? You can

are acquainted. It would be

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.634
at all. But there is this way of

e6f3bdbe-d23e-4eb1-bfd3-5fc27cd4f670
00:09:54.634 --> 00:09:58.675
leveraging. Leveraging, I'm
not sure there is this way of

leveraging your acquaintance.

and so although at bottom it
comes right down to

be7df20d-4b38-4ccd-a1fe-d5abb04abe8b

acquaintance everything
Russell says rests upon

a68ebfbc-a998-493f-8552-5c4c4803a7bb
