00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.818
that actually it

different from the vocalist who

different drummers. Sometimes

I said to Mrs B, ‘the vocalist

about? There is no vocalist.

different from the vocalist today.

really fit, and it seems that

00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:55.274
what I was trying to express

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.200

vocalist because today’s
vocalist isn't doing better than

about yesterday's vocalist.

of them, because I'm clearly

ddef62af-0500-44ae-bdad-0180a5425179
00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:12.222
trying to contrast one person.
It was just a thought about

00:03:12.222 --> 00:03:14.632
nobody. Likewise, where Mrs B
was on about the drummer,

NOTE Confidence: 0.79757905

19c5d915-8cc2-40b5-b1cc-e7ea29f841a0
00:03:14.632 --> 00:03:16.801
she wasn't thinking

you'd have to be pretty serious

false. Generally

So if you're a skeptic about

and you should probably expect
it too. So I've got a

to do is use that contradiction

I suppose that that were true,
that you're not acquainted with

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.688
reject the supposition. I
think that you're acquainted

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:22.032
Now, I'm not saying for a moment
that this argument is

I think it's an argument that's

worth thinking carefully about.
This is the argument from the

possibility of massive

that Russell's principle of

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.280
something very like it you're

Principle. Now that's not very
careful. If I was being much

concluded. Let's go back a

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.840
Now, of course, that's not quite
Russell's principle. That could

a4a1caca-5ded-43bd-83ef-759461d65a31
00:11:18.105 --> 00:11:20.690
could be false. Because if you

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.750
remember, Russell's Principle
of Acquaintance says

NOTE Confidence: 0.8603611

5ed16815-243b-4568-8617-8c91f56aebf6
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.340
that every proposition which we
can understand is composed

72a33a5f-2ca5-47f3-b1eb-0c6481308467
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.840
wholly of constituents with
which were acquainted.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.292
Or another way
that Russell formulates the

all of our knowledge of

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.754
So what we have here, I take
it, is an argument that

5bef3e98-7c8d-44ed-892b-a0907721888e
00:11:47.754 --> 00:11:49.570
doesn't quite give us

It gives us an argument for
the idea that

To the world without
