This is an optional extra

know that Russell endorses the

principle of acquaintance. Here
it is. Every proposition which we

what's

He says, ‘It seems to me that
the truth of this principle

the Principle of Acquaintance. I

think there is an argument here
somewhere. Russell says the theory

75d62ddf-6701-43d0-b81a-9e86cb4f2436

that judgments consist of ideas
is fundamentally mistaken. And

87db2c13-0fae-443a-8497-d173bebbb51a

what does he mean by that? He
goes on to say the view.

So I take it this is the theory
that judgment is consist of

that there is some mental

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.810
So here's the cool part. What is
Russell going to say? Well, I'll

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.540
tell you. Glad you asked. He
says I see no reason to believe

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.740
that when we were acquainted
with an object, the Puffin,

NOTE Confidence: 0.854399859905243

52f9eaf1-e171-495f-bf05-dfc17c6a3601
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.580
there is another something which
can be called the idea of the

48c9a0d3-1e37-4ee5-b5ff-14aef21011b1

object, On the contrary.

fad7f12e-3d99-431e-8b50-67c0b1b55686
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.217
I hope that acquaintance is
holier relation. Not demanding

NOTE Confidence: 0.783731877803802

983ec866-d68a-4f2b-a42f-f659cbc36478
00:04:09.217 --> 00:04:12.973
any such constituent of the mind
as opposed by the advocate of

00:04:12.973 --> 00:04:15.790
ideas. So the relational view,
the acquaintance view that

8f91965f-30b1-47b1-895e-64000057b66d
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.233
Russell has is there's two
things me and the Puffin, the

NOTE Confidence: 0.783731877803802

1470004b-6f65-4abb-9db4-823d4c73eb0f
00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:22.989
ideas view that he's attacking
here as he presents it is the

NOTE Confidence: 0.783731877803802

256b1ffd-5d23-48ad-a8eb-cb282e668f54
00:04:22.989 --> 00:04:26.432
claim that there are three
things me. The idea of the

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:29.562
profit and the Puffin itself.
And Russell says since the

NOTE Confidence: 0.783731877803802

62a1bb20-4abe-4084-a9bd-be59dbe08346
00:04:29.562 --> 00:04:33.005
relation between the idea of the

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:35.822
obscur, introducing those ideas
is just creating problems. I'm

NOTE Confidence: 0.783731877803802

6afdb3e7-7675-4b6d-a9b8-0fe8aea9ea89
00:04:35.822 --> 00:04:37.387
going to read read those

00:04:37.387 --> 00:04:39.775
altogether. I'm just going to
have direct relation between me

NOTE Confidence: 0.754772067070007

c6ba69df-c721-4aa0-ba18-6e4c36ec82e7
00:04:39.775 --> 00:04:42.025
and the Puffin. The relation
acquaintance, no ideas at all.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84249746799469

4014325f-1d9a-4b66-a5dd-f8a6c52635fd
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.490
So here's the crux of it. The
theory that judgment consists

25bb7594-3d62-475a-a489-d3c507a54641
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.290
of ideas, says Russell is
fundamentally mistaken.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84249746799469

693fc29c-363c-43f8-a85e-80b8e47921a3
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.290
Acquaintances, holier
relation, not demanding

NOTE Confidence: 0.84249746799469

6d098772-029c-455c-ac32-5c4132a6b778
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.890
anything like an idea.

3e838545-ca25-4708-9a0c-58553bb5a79e
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.286
Now I think there's an attempt.
An argument here for the

a7f1e634-c0fa-44c1-a3dd-14ecfd374ea0
00:04:58.286 --> 00:05:00.946
principle of acquaintance. I'm
not certain about this, but I

NOTE Confidence: 0.809435546398163

0f7a198b-3fb5-4882-bd5a-a4f0281d67b9
00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:04.670
think they might be, and I think
if I were to reconstruct it, I'd

NOTE Confidence: 0.809435546398163

810e23ee-dfc4-4c48-85ac-c382d6a2295a
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.734
say something like this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.835364758968353

6fd8cf4c-f88b-4492-888f-3ad0aabfa926
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.930
When things go well, our
thoughts about things in the

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.810
world. I'm going to your case
when things don't go well. We're

NOTE Confidence: 0.835364758968353

6dfcad1f-aa80-4577-9927-7abee92ed54a
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.210
not thinking about anything at
all. Of course, it's possible

NOTE Confidence: 0.826741993427277

c59d5a93-0b27-4098-9ea9-9097c5a4c441
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.736
to. Fake, think as we might call
it, but it's not always like

00:05:18.736 --> 00:05:23.158
that. Secondly, any theory
of thought needs to

efea1a57-a765-445e-bcc6-75ae955b4ab9

between thoughts and things.

actually what we're trying to do

97e46616-11a0-445e-a49e-f81fcde44134
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.200
in this course, or at least
we're exploring that idea.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.203
Invoking ideas says Russell to
do this makes matters more, not

less obscure. Now is very good
case for that. You may not be

pretty good reasons to reject
that idea given the last sort of

thought consists of bottom in a

acquaintance. So if this is
right, we've got close to

an argument.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.098
For the principle acquaintance,
I say close to you because this

that isn't quite the principle

00:06:06.978 --> 00:06:10.186
acquaintance. The other thing
I wanted to mention here is

NOTE Confidence: 0.839243233203888

8e116f3c-336e-445e-b71f-327d5c74fd97
00:06:10.186 --> 00:06:12.298
I'm using this time
intentionality for the first

6118a212-bf8f-4dd3-8f03-702a046711e6
00:06:12.298 --> 00:06:15.202
time, so I want to highlight
that by intentionality. I just

NOTE Confidence: 0.839243233203888

d8332802-85ab-4f0f-b283-e522fa04bac5
00:06:15.202 --> 00:06:18.634
mean this idea of point of
view. So the idea is that the

intentionality of thought is
the fact that your thoughts.

Are a matter of you having a
point of view of the world when

00:06:25.464 --> 00:06:27.498
you're thinking about something.
There's a relation between you

00:06:27.498 --> 00:06:30.335
and a thing. That's
intentionality, as I understand

NOTE Confidence: 0.844964385032654

479ecdb1-5a9c-4aa7-8965-8520ebb2cb45

now, of course you can get into
all kinds of hot water with this

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:38.192
term intentionality. But here
I'm using it in a way, just as a

shorthand for talking about
points of view. So I might have

00:06:41.393 --> 00:06:44.594
said, look, the fact that in
virtue of having thoughts, you

have a point of view on certain
parts of the world consists of

f94daf16-fe3a-45cf-bb8f-bbe5499a283c
00:06:48.377 --> 00:06:52.160
what men are relation between, I
think are in an object. So it

NOTE Confidence: 0.844964385032654

54103765-5edb-4e2f-b48e-31b74b8b9150
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.779
really need that term.
Intentionality there at all. So

ada7c2f1-8bd2-45bb-8318-d1138ee3a1fc
00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:57.398

anything. You are complicated,

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.227
So here's what I think might
be an argument that Russell

NOTE Confidence: 0.80815178155899

e5872534-7234-41f9-9180-aa6ee275adac
00:07:01.227 --> 00:07:03.597
gave for the principle of
acquaintance. Or it might be

5cae424e-4af7-4170-9e6b-2a8c5fb38cef
00:07:03.597 --> 00:07:06.204
wrong. Maybe that's not what
Russell had in mind at all.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80815178155899

147c0673-806c-4f62-8518-e8973320f614
00:07:06.204 --> 00:07:08.100
Maybe the arguments against
one, maybe it's not.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.873
I'm not sure he is the argument
that this this is my attempt.

OK, So what do I want to
emphasize here? Well, actually

f676ce92-b8d0-4469-ba65-1bcaef0f7edc
00:07:17.207 --> 00:07:18.428
something pretty simple.
