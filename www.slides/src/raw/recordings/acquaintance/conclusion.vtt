So well done for getting this
far. Unless of course you just

jumped straight to the
conclusion. That's actually a

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:08.756
pretty good idea.

In conclusion, weâ€™re thinking about

the Principle of Acquaintance. 
This is just an interim

conclusion: there's plenty more
that we still need to do around

this topic to deepen our
understanding. But it's worth

The  broad question that we've been
focused on is

how do your thoughts connect to
the things about which you think

candidate answer. To that

are the main things that

we have discovered in
