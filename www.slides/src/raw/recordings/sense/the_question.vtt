NOTE Confidence: 0.840848028659821

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.525
So our next topic is sense and
reference. Now I don't want to

NOTE Confidence: 0.826864361763

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:10.530
tell you. Too much about the
topic here. 'cause That's going

NOTE Confidence: 0.826864361763

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.890
to be quite difficult. Instead,
I want to start by giving you

NOTE Confidence: 0.826864361763

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.570
just a hint at the difficulty

NOTE Confidence: 0.846592128276825

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.008
we’re supposed to imagine. Sense and
reference is one of those really

NOTE Confidence: 0.846592128276825

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:22.320
foundational topics that I think
you're going to find useful in a

NOTE Confidence: 0.846592128276825

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.424
whole variety of things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.860469579696655

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.640
At times when we're talking
about this, it's going to seem

NOTE Confidence: 0.860469579696655

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.500
perhaps to some people just a

NOTE Confidence: 0.870187699794769

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.319
tiny bit technical. But what we
already discovering is some.

NOTE Confidence: 0.848954379558563

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.150
Key feature about the nature of
mines feature that was

NOTE Confidence: 0.848954379558563

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.420
discovered more than 100 years
ago and has proved absolutely

NOTE Confidence: 0.848954379558563

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.690
fundamental in Merritt. In many
areas of thinking about minds.

NOTE Confidence: 0.848954379558563

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.633
It's also relevant for thinking
about communication with words

NOTE Confidence: 0.848954379558563

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:51.230
as well. So it comes up in
philosophy of language. But

NOTE Confidence: 0.848954379558563

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.481
we're going to approach this, of
course in mind and reality as a.

NOTE Confidence: 0.646732866764069

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.798
Philosophy of mind topic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.887490808963776

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.408
So let me start with a simple
story. Hang on a second.

NOTE Confidence: 0.805013597011566

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.552
Now I'm ready to start with
the simple story. This is from

NOTE Confidence: 0.805013597011566

00:01:05.552 --> 00:01:06.436
a philosophy called Richard.

NOTE Confidence: 0.858582735061646

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.656
Andrea is in her office on the
telephone to her friend. Then

NOTE Confidence: 0.858582735061646

00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:13.752
there she is chattering away.
She looks out of the window and

NOTE Confidence: 0.858582735061646

00:01:13.752 --> 00:01:16.848
she notices a man on the street
below who's using his mobile

NOTE Confidence: 0.858582735061646

00:01:16.848 --> 00:01:19.428
phone right? You see people
doing this The Walking around

NOTE Confidence: 0.858582735061646

00:01:19.428 --> 00:01:22.266
with the mobile phones. They're
kind of like zombies to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.858582735061646

00:01:22.266 --> 00:01:25.104
world when they're doing this.
They're just all kind of, you

NOTE Confidence: 0.858582735061646

00:01:25.104 --> 00:01:28.200
know, really into this and this
guy is clearly having a good

NOTE Confidence: 0.858582735061646

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.038
time on his phone. He's not
looking where he's going, he's

NOTE Confidence: 0.858582735061646

00:01:31.038 --> 00:01:33.102
about to step in front of a bus

NOTE Confidence: 0.865697205066681

00:01:33.102 --> 00:01:37.165
that can happen. Andrea, looking
out of the window doesn't

NOTE Confidence: 0.865697205066681

00:01:37.165 --> 00:01:40.945
realize that this man is Ben,
the French speaking to on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.843965172767639

00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:45.100
phone. So what she does, she
hangs on the window. She

NOTE Confidence: 0.843965172767639

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.764
waves frantically in an
attempt to warn the man.

NOTE Confidence: 0.863977432250977

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.733
But she says nothing into the
phone. She doesn't say anything

NOTE Confidence: 0.848721623420715

00:01:52.733 --> 00:01:56.799
to Ben himself. OK, so there's
the story very good now. Richard

NOTE Confidence: 0.848721623420715

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.425
doesn't tell us how the story

NOTE Confidence: 0.805764615535736

00:01:58.425 --> 00:02:03.020
ends. We know that Andreas is
nothing into the phone. We know

NOTE Confidence: 0.805764615535736

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.740
that she doesn't realize that
the man is Ben. We don't know

NOTE Confidence: 0.805764615535736

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.770
what happens after that. Now you
could imagine this in a kind of

NOTE Confidence: 0.805764615535736

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.320
ASDF style. I like trains.

NOTE Confidence: 0.811586201190948

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.534
I prefer to imagine that story
is having a happier ending, so

NOTE Confidence: 0.811586201190948

00:02:15.534 --> 00:02:18.471
my version of the story richer
doesn't say this, but what

NOTE Confidence: 0.811586201190948

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:21.942
happens is that the bus driver
slams on the brakes. No one in

NOTE Confidence: 0.811586201190948

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:25.146
the bus is hurt. Richard Ben
steps back from the pavement and

NOTE Confidence: 0.811586201190948

00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:28.083
the bus driver does a certain
amount of cursing and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.811586201190948

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:30.486
everyone goes out there way,
Ben. Suitably chastened, right?

NOTE Confidence: 0.811586201190948

00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:33.423
He's not going to be walking
around talking on this phone

NOTE Confidence: 0.811586201190948

00:02:33.423 --> 00:02:34.491
again in a hurry.

NOTE Confidence: 0.863251149654388

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.560
Stupid thing to do now?

NOTE Confidence: 0.791241049766541

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.030
So the crux of the story is
this something that Andrea

NOTE Confidence: 0.791241049766541

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.280
doesn't realize? What doesn't
matter, I realize. Well, simple

NOTE Confidence: 0.791241049766541

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.530
that this man is been right. If
she knew that that was Ben

NOTE Confidence: 0.791241049766541

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.280
should be telling Ben into the
phone, stop the bus coming.

NOTE Confidence: 0.791241049766541

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.530
Don't walk into the street.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83083164691925

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.522
So why is that interesting? Why
is there any kind of problem

NOTE Confidence: 0.812838792800903

00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:57.124
here? Well, let's think about an
inference. I want to show you

NOTE Confidence: 0.812838792800903

00:02:57.124 --> 00:02:59.664
very, very simple inference
here. Here's an inference man is

NOTE Confidence: 0.812838792800903

00:02:59.664 --> 00:03:01.188
about to step in this man.

NOTE Confidence: 0.818111836910248

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.587
The man that Andrea see through
the window is about to step out

NOTE Confidence: 0.874441146850586

00:03:04.587 --> 00:03:08.310
in front of us. Secondly, this
man is Ben.

NOTE Confidence: 0.893452227115631

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.760
Therefore, if you know those two
things, you can conclude as a

NOTE Confidence: 0.844679832458496

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.010
matter of logic. That Ben is
about to step out in front of

NOTE Confidence: 0.834713995456696

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.916
her boss. I want to go slowly
here and really emphasize to you

NOTE Confidence: 0.788547575473785

00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:22.928
that this inferences. A
logically valid inference.

NOTE Confidence: 0.887349426746368

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.910
If you know the premises you
were justified in asserting

NOTE Confidence: 0.887349426746368

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.382
the conclusion purely as a
matter of logic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83090603351593

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.220
Thing to note here partly is
that he is in this man is Ben is

NOTE Confidence: 0.83090603351593

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.760
the is of numerical identity,
right? We're saying that there

NOTE Confidence: 0.83090603351593

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.062
is just one thing here. Seems
like there are two, but in fact

NOTE Confidence: 0.83090603351593

00:03:40.062 --> 00:03:42.856
there's just one. This is the is
of numerical identity, whereas

NOTE Confidence: 0.83090603351593

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:46.666
of course the other is is this
man is about step in front of us

NOTE Confidence: 0.83090603351593

00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:49.460
and so on. What's happening?
There is nothing to do with

NOTE Confidence: 0.83090603351593

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.238
identity, that's just
predication, right? We're just

NOTE Confidence: 0.83090603351593

00:03:51.238 --> 00:03:53.778
saying something about these men
were talking about some property

NOTE Confidence: 0.83090603351593

00:03:53.778 --> 00:03:56.826
that these men have. Write the
property of being about step in

NOTE Confidence: 0.86802089214325

00:03:56.826 --> 00:03:59.539
front of us. Very good now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.866997539997101

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.660
I think about this in terms of
1st order logic, so you may

NOTE Confidence: 0.866997539997101

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.940
have done first or logic you
may be doing that next term.

NOTE Confidence: 0.866997539997101

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.220
I'm not really sure, but it's
going to be helpful to you

NOTE Confidence: 0.866997539997101

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.500
either way to think about it
in terms of 1st year logic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.851373672485352

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.286
So what we can do is formalize
this little inference and what

NOTE Confidence: 0.851373672485352

00:04:14.286 --> 00:04:18.528
I've got here is a that stands
for this man. That's a name for

NOTE Confidence: 0.851373672485352

00:04:18.528 --> 00:04:22.164
the man that Andrea is looking
out at through the window names

NOTE Confidence: 0.897361695766449

00:04:22.164 --> 00:04:24.290
the person itself. And a

NOTE Confidence: 0.826898336410522

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.638
predicate. Which stands for is
about to step out in front of us

NOTE Confidence: 0.826898336410522

00:04:27.638 --> 00:04:30.206
and I chose to write. The
predicate is at risk, So what

NOTE Confidence: 0.826898336410522

00:04:30.206 --> 00:04:31.490
you see happening here in the?

NOTE Confidence: 0.78933721780777

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.497
Logical sentences. We've got a
name. We've got a predicate in

NOTE Confidence: 0.78933721780777

00:04:35.497 --> 00:04:38.467
the predicates being applied to
the name. Very simple. Let's

NOTE Confidence: 0.78933721780777

00:04:38.467 --> 00:04:42.031
have a look at the next premise.
Well, the next premises, a

NOTE Confidence: 0.78933721780777

00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:45.001
simple statement of identity.
Here the equal sign stands for

NOTE Confidence: 0.78933721780777

00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:47.971
numerical identity and what
we're saying is that A&B are.

NOTE Confidence: 0.850916087627411

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.670
Numerical identical,
they are one thing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.795949578285217

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.820
Very good and then the
conclusion of course, does at

NOTE Confidence: 0.795949578285217

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.940
Risk B where B is the name I
picked for Andrea's friend Ben.

NOTE Confidence: 0.873100697994232

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.156
And I mentioned this because I
wanted to stress that if you

NOTE Confidence: 0.873100697994232

00:05:04.156 --> 00:05:07.599
look at that logical argument,
you can clearly see that the

NOTE Confidence: 0.873100697994232

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.729
conclusion follows from the
premise as a matter of logical

NOTE Confidence: 0.873100697994232

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.172
consequence, this is just a very
simple application of the rule

NOTE Confidence: 0.873100697994232

00:05:14.172 --> 00:05:17.615
that you will come to know and
Love as identity elimination.

NOTE Confidence: 0.873100697994232

00:05:17.615 --> 00:05:21.058
Apply that identity elimination
rule and you get from the two

NOTE Confidence: 0.873100697994232

00:05:21.058 --> 00:05:23.875
premises to the conclusion that
Ben is at risk.

NOTE Confidence: 0.875660479068756

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.046
So what Andrea is failing to do?

NOTE Confidence: 0.864404022693634

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.976
Her failure can only be, but she
doesn't know that this man is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.864404022693634

00:05:31.976 --> 00:05:34.858
Then that's the only thing that
can prevent her from drawing

NOTE Confidence: 0.864404022693634

00:05:34.858 --> 00:05:37.478
this conclusion. Everything else
follows as a matter of logic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831981837749481

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.750
Why am I stressing this?

NOTE Confidence: 0.821948647499084

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.480
Well. Let's go and have a look
at about what people say about

NOTE Confidence: 0.821948647499084

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.990
numerical identity. We're
talking here about a fact about

NOTE Confidence: 0.821948647499084

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.110
numerical identity. Andrea
doesn't know that David Lewis

NOTE Confidence: 0.821948647499084

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.010
very famous meta physician says
identity is utterly simple and

NOTE Confidence: 0.909857392311096

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.652
unproblematic. Everything is

NOTE Confidence: 0.878616154193878

00:05:59.652 --> 00:06:03.386
identical to itself. Nothing is
ever identical to anything

NOTE Confidence: 0.856337547302246

00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:07.354
except itself. Now that's
true. People are sometimes

NOTE Confidence: 0.856337547302246

00:06:07.354 --> 00:06:11.444
confused about this because
they think about identity in a

NOTE Confidence: 0.856337547302246

00:06:11.444 --> 00:06:13.080
political or cultural sense.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899016141891479

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.720
Alright, so I might have. I
might say, you know I have an

NOTE Confidence: 0.899016141891479

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.470
identity as a British citizen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.810621023178101

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.324
But here I'm not really talking
about identity in their logical

NOTE Confidence: 0.810621023178101

00:06:24.324 --> 00:06:27.060
sense at all. There's nothing
that I'm numerically identical

NOTE Confidence: 0.810621023178101

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.404
to in virtue of being British
citizen, at least on any

NOTE Confidence: 0.810621023178101

00:06:30.404 --> 00:06:31.924
sensible view of the matter.

NOTE Confidence: 0.878879547119141

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.782
This is just some property that
I happened to have write the

NOTE Confidence: 0.878879547119141

00:06:35.782 --> 00:06:37.162
property of being a British

NOTE Confidence: 0.806077003479004

00:06:37.162 --> 00:06:40.286
citizen so clearly. When we're
talking about identity, there

NOTE Confidence: 0.806077003479004

00:06:40.286 --> 00:06:42.860
were talking about the identity
of predication. The link

NOTE Confidence: 0.806077003479004

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.148
between me and a property
something quite different.

NOTE Confidence: 0.806077003479004

00:06:45.148 --> 00:06:46.578
Likewise for the cultural
things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.835131168365479

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.730
Lewis goes on. There never was
any problem about what makes

NOTE Confidence: 0.835131168365479

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.230
something identical to itself.
Nothing can ever fail to be

NOTE Confidence: 0.835131168365479

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.730
identical to itself, nor says
Lewis. Is there any problem

NOTE Confidence: 0.835131168365479

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.480
about what makes two things

NOTE Confidence: 0.834106922149658

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.761
identical? Afterall, two things
can't be identical, otherwise

NOTE Confidence: 0.834106922149658

00:07:03.761 --> 00:07:04.790
they'd be one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.816102147102356

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.042
Very sensible. So Lewis is point
is that identity is utterly

NOTE Confidence: 0.816102147102356

00:07:10.042 --> 00:07:12.338
simple and unproblematic. There
isn't really anything

NOTE Confidence: 0.816102147102356

00:07:12.338 --> 00:07:13.650
interesting for philosopher to

NOTE Confidence: 0.872279167175293

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.980
do here. But here's the problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.807332158088684

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.240
According to another perhaps
equally famous philosopher

NOTE Confidence: 0.807332158088684

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.740
Fragar, who's responsible for
this whole discussion on sensor

NOTE Confidence: 0.831631898880005

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.794
reference? Identity gives rise
to challenging questions which

NOTE Confidence: 0.831631898880005

00:07:28.794 --> 00:07:33.216
are not altogether easy to
answer, Huh? So now we gotta

NOTE Confidence: 0.576456308364868

00:07:33.216 --> 00:07:35.780
conflict. Frege thinks

NOTE Confidence: 0.824145674705505

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.700
that Richards little story about
Andrea and Ben and other

NOTE Confidence: 0.824145674705505

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.560
variants of it that he has.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89017790555954

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.397
Revealed that there's some
interesting challenge concerning

NOTE Confidence: 0.89017790555954

00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:47.201
the nature of identity.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8863844871521

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.448
And the nature of our thoughts.

NOTE Confidence: 0.79869270324707

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.010
On the other hand, there are
philosophers like Louis. You

NOTE Confidence: 0.79869270324707

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.938
make a very good case for the
idea that identity is utterly

NOTE Confidence: 0.79869270324707

00:07:55.938 --> 00:07:56.670
simple and unproblematic.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8337681889534

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.786
So one of the things we need to
do in thinking about sense of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8337681889534

00:08:01.786 --> 00:08:04.910
references try to understand why
does fragar think that the case

NOTE Confidence: 0.8337681889534

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.614
of Andrea and Ben is so

NOTE Confidence: 0.826175689697266

00:08:06.614 --> 00:08:10.140
puzzling? I guess that in fact
contradict what Lewis is saying

NOTE Confidence: 0.826175689697266

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.500
about identity. Let's find out.
