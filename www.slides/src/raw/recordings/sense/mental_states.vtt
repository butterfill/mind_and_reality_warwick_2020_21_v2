NOTE Confidence: 0.906962156295776

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.181
One thing that's going to be a
big issue in mind and reality.

NOTE Confidence: 0.914409101009369

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.240
Is the notion of a mental state.

NOTE Confidence: 0.814986050128937

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.550
Not surprising, the course is
about the mind. Mental states,

NOTE Confidence: 0.814986050128937

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.940
key components of the mind.

NOTE Confidence: 0.806996285915375

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.290
Sort of mental states well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.844520032405853

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.329
If I say to you, Ian believes
Clark is in the library. I'm

NOTE Confidence: 0.844520032405853

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.445
talking about a mental state
that Ian has in this case of

NOTE Confidence: 0.854223847389221

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:32.070
belief. Or you might say Steve
desires that Clark fly, and

NOTE Confidence: 0.854223847389221

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.085
again, you're talking about some
kind of mental state that I

NOTE Confidence: 0.813944280147552

00:00:36.085 --> 00:00:40.932
have. Or, you know, we could
say Aisha intends that

NOTE Confidence: 0.813944280147552

00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:44.812
Superman fly once again. That
intention is a mental state.

NOTE Confidence: 0.875042140483856

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.920
Now for all purposes, it's
helpful to think about mental

NOTE Confidence: 0.875042140483856

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.565
states as having three key
components. They have a

NOTE Confidence: 0.875042140483856

00:00:53.565 --> 00:00:57.615
subject and attitude and a
content. Let's take a quick

NOTE Confidence: 0.875042140483856

00:00:57.615 --> 00:01:02.070
look at each of those so the
subject is the individual

NOTE Confidence: 0.875042140483856

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.500
thing which bears the mental
state.

NOTE Confidence: 0.879597723484039

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.644
Questions about the subject of
mental states are going to come

NOTE Confidence: 0.879597723484039

00:01:09.644 --> 00:01:14.012
up twice. They're going to come
up once if you think about

NOTE Confidence: 0.879597723484039

00:01:14.012 --> 00:01:17.652
personal identity, the identity
of the bearer of mental States

NOTE Confidence: 0.879597723484039

00:01:17.652 --> 00:01:22.384
and they might also come up
again if you ask the question of

NOTE Confidence: 0.879597723484039

00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:26.024
whether the subject of mental
states always have to be

NOTE Confidence: 0.879597723484039

00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:29.300
individuals, or whether there's
any interesting and useful sense

NOTE Confidence: 0.879597723484039

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.940
in which multiple individuals
can be said collectively to have

NOTE Confidence: 0.879597723484039

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.488
a mental state like a desire or

NOTE Confidence: 0.896544635295868

00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:38.785
intention. Sorry if I say to

NOTE Confidence: 0.852136671543121

00:01:38.785 --> 00:01:41.220
you. We desire.

NOTE Confidence: 0.883171737194061

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.750
To eat dinner I'm I'm talking
about a mental state.

NOTE Confidence: 0.845345139503479

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.251
That we collectively have one
state, many people. Or am I

NOTE Confidence: 0.845345139503479

00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:52.361
simply summarizing a situation
in which each of us desires

NOTE Confidence: 0.845345139503479

00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:55.471
that we have dinner? OK
anyway, subject of the mental

NOTE Confidence: 0.845345139503479

00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:58.581
state? That's the individual
thing, or set of things that

NOTE Confidence: 0.845345139503479

00:01:58.581 --> 00:01:59.825
bears the mental state.

NOTE Confidence: 0.828784286975861

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.560
The attitude is something like
believing, desiring or

NOTE Confidence: 0.867065072059631

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.016
intending. Attitudes are
typically characterized by their

NOTE Confidence: 0.867065072059631

00:02:09.016 --> 00:02:11.220
functional and normative roles.

NOTE Confidence: 0.860336780548096

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.092
So, for example, someone might
say look the functional role of

NOTE Confidence: 0.860336780548096

00:02:16.092 --> 00:02:20.404
beliefs, put it very simply, is
to ensure that an agent's

NOTE Confidence: 0.860336780548096

00:02:20.404 --> 00:02:23.932
actions align with some facts,
even when information about

NOTE Confidence: 0.860336780548096

00:02:23.932 --> 00:02:27.852
those facts is no longer
available. So here's the great

NOTE Confidence: 0.860336780548096

00:02:27.852 --> 00:02:29.028
thing about belief.

NOTE Confidence: 0.865489780902863

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.780
I'm over here and I encounter
some information about where

NOTE Confidence: 0.865489780902863

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.912
this delicious food is. Now I
have to go away to another

NOTE Confidence: 0.865489780902863

00:02:35.912 --> 00:02:38.522
place I no longer have the
information about the foods

NOTE Confidence: 0.865489780902863

00:02:38.522 --> 00:02:41.915
location, but if I get hungry I
can still return to that place

NOTE Confidence: 0.865489780902863

00:02:41.915 --> 00:02:44.786
and I hope that's food there.
That's the function of belief.

NOTE Confidence: 0.865489780902863

00:02:44.786 --> 00:02:47.657
It's allowing me to align my
actions with the fact even

NOTE Confidence: 0.865489780902863

00:02:47.657 --> 00:02:50.006
though I have no current
information about those facts

NOTE Confidence: 0.865489780902863

00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:50.528
at all.

NOTE Confidence: 0.866163790225983

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.470
So this is a very simple
example of how we might try

NOTE Confidence: 0.866163790225983

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.535
very crudely to characterize
functional roles of

NOTE Confidence: 0.866163790225983

00:02:57.535 --> 00:02:59.600
different attitudes and
distinguish them. That's a

NOTE Confidence: 0.866163790225983

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.255
big topic in philosophy, but
it's not something that

NOTE Confidence: 0.866163790225983

00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:04.910
we're going to consider in
this course at all.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919804394245148

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.757
Now the third component of a
mental state is the content.

NOTE Confidence: 0.890002727508545

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.708
So I might believe that Clark is
in the library. Where is you

NOTE Confidence: 0.890002727508545

00:03:18.708 --> 00:03:21.204
believe that Clark is in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.854723155498505

00:03:21.204 --> 00:03:25.722
kitchen? So those two mental
states are distinguished by

NOTE Confidence: 0.854723155498505

00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:29.274
having different contents, same
attitude, belief, but different

NOTE Confidence: 0.888628602027893

00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:34.889
contents. The idea here is that
the content is what makes a

NOTE Confidence: 0.888628602027893

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.300
belief true or false. What
determines the conditions under

NOTE Confidence: 0.888628602027893

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.090
which a desire will be satisfied
or unsatisfied, an intention,

NOTE Confidence: 0.888628602027893

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.606
fulfilled and unfulfilled, and

NOTE Confidence: 0.865322053432465

00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:49.106
so on. One of the big topics for
this course will be about the

NOTE Confidence: 0.865322053432465

00:03:49.106 --> 00:03:52.879
nature of the contents of mental
states. That's the topic called

NOTE Confidence: 0.865322053432465

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:53.908
sense and reference.
