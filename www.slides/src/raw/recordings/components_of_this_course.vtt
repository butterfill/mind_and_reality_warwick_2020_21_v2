How does the work that we'll
be doing for this course

that you will be assessed on.

There is a 2 hour exam in
summer 2021. (Now if you're

worried about whether that will happen,

I'm sure we'll find
some alternative form of

assessment if it comes to
it.)

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.205
In the two hour exam you will be
given a choice of six questions

e4fbf4cc-a0c8-4eac-bc78-725ee2a5dce8
00:00:25.205 --> 00:00:28.230
and you'll select two to write
about. I hate surprises, so

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.980
those six questions are going to
be essentially the questions

that I've just been talking
about earlier in this lecture,

and that the whole lectures
are based on. So you already know

roughly what those questions
are. They're just going to be

variants of the questions that
were investigating on the

in November you'll be given a
choice of, I think, 6 questions.

You'll be asked to write answers to
3 questions, and those questions

the main work that

And on top of that, there are
these in-lecture micro tasks
