Personal identity is an new topic
for us. Let's just try and get

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.950
The broad idea is look what's
necessary for your personal

something like I would say

But it's not what we're thinking

5ffdff9f-8c14-4f40-aabb-4ad16bef0b7e

that what you're saying is,

something true. If you say ‘I am
a different person now’,

So you're sort of getting into
some kind of tangle. We

00:01:17.772 --> 00:01:22.022
So here's a way of
formulating the question that

here's the question.

that the person is the thing?

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.510
So here is Olson’s formulation
of a question about personal

Focus very carefully on this

The first thing to note here is
that identifying a person is
