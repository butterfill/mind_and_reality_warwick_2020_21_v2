Does identity matter?

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.087
This question arises because
we've been discussing

think that if biological

for. And in that case, it seems
that the issue of personal

biological continuity views. And

I think philosophers, perhaps

cut words out. Here's the

practical concerns are closely

an ethical consequence, namely
that those practical relations
