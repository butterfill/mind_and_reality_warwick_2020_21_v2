00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.180
So let's look at.

metaphysically necessary for

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.996
answer involves appeal to
psychological continuity.

carefully as I can, because

although the idea is simple,
it's very easy to get confused

dd429014-4ff7-4fcb-a11a-02e2bd24d0be

this is the view.

it's the case. That one thing is

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.126
Very simple. What would be the
problems with this view? Well

00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:23.702
firstly as I formulated it here,
we're focusing just on memories,

NOTE Confidence: 0.847997426986694

4a657246-f9f0-4387-b656-5eb292857029
00:01:23.702 --> 00:01:28.694
but you might think that that's
much too narrow. You might take

00:01:32.022 --> 00:01:36.182
example, the way that emotions
unfold overtime. You go through

NOTE Confidence: 0.847997426986694

9a655e22-6529-4f8e-9864-37c386292c28
00:01:36.182 --> 00:01:40.342
a period of grief. Your grief
unfolds over months, and

c02aec03-3fd8-4ee9-b2fb-5bc48c5e52c3
00:01:40.342 --> 00:01:44.918
Fortunately many cases over some
years, and the person who is

d6139fd8-f926-4142-989d-073d0be0fcb4
00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:49.380
grieving. Now that grief is
shaped by the way that the

5db58768-0d02-4952-84f8-4e3fc3857eee
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.758
grief was happening earlier,
so we could expand this to to

NOTE Confidence: 0.880628287792206

64f40657-42b1-4c17-87a8-c1e350632ea9
00:01:53.758 --> 00:01:56.942
take into account more than
memories. That's one

00:01:56.942 --> 00:02:00.126
possibility, but the details
there won't affect the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.246
The other thing we need to think
about here is transitivity. So

12adb2e9-03a5-401a-87f5-1287ae5d8795
00:02:08.246 --> 00:02:11.726
if we're potentially making a
claim about identity, we want

00:02:11.726 --> 00:02:15.554
the identity relation to be
transitive, so it's no good. For

7b2a5fc8-6c18-4b17-9b5d-9be8baa365cd
00:02:15.554 --> 00:02:18.686
example, if the second smallest
person here can remember

5b575bb7-e99b-466b-84cf-4d6bfe17b06a
00:02:18.686 --> 00:02:22.514
something of the first smallest
person, I criterion would be met

00:02:22.514 --> 00:02:25.994
and the third smallest person
can remember something of the

22e65d76-cdfb-4912-bd57-50c4f9bccb42

Then you might want to say Well

look the first ones identical to

yourself. Now here, there's a
