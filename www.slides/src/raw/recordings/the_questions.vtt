Hi, welcome back. As the course
is structured around 7 questions

idea to introduce you to the 7

questions right away. These are the
seven questions that we will

investigate over the nine weeks
of this course. So what are

those questions? What are those

questions? Well, the first one
is bout acquaintance. How do

This is actually a very

answer. The answer comes from a

Bertrand Russell.

00:01:02.034 --> 00:01:05.400

clearest thing he says about. I

good. There are things that you
can think about you. Think about

something I think about a lot.

about the Puffin. You could have

you had no way of singling it

So here's the thought Russell's
making a very simple point.

There is a distinction between
the things you can think about

about. What makes that

00:02:29.108 --> 00:02:32.684
distinction is the fact that you
know some things and you don't

know others. Now that I've
introduced you to Puffin, you

00:02:35.664 --> 00:02:37.154
can think about puffing before

00:02:37.154 --> 00:02:40.192
you couldn't. To Russell

way. Now one thing I do, and
philosophers give us lots of

words I like to go through and
cut out some of the words that

d7bb94a3-7952-415b-85df-bda3fd3da38c
00:02:46.276 --> 00:02:49.084
you don't need. So here I'm
cutting out some of the words.

00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:51.424
It's very good exercise. We want
the fewest words possible

because each word costs a lot of
effort on our part. That's bad.

philosophers are lazy for

00:03:01.777 --> 00:03:05.341
and cut out words. Sometimes
you cut out words and it turns

cut out some words here. I
think I've got Russell saying

this whenever, supposing or
judging occurs, the terms to

which the supposing or judging
mind is thereby related must be

So the difference between before
when you couldn't think that's

can think thoughts about puffing

about? So Russell thinks that

So what good question? Well,
several philosophers among them,

What relation, well, it's a
relation between the mind and

OK, very good. So if you're

something very similar to

for saying that Lois sees the

there is an argument against

where he is. And of course, if

but Lois doesn't know where the

like Goodman, you're not a
skeptic about induction. Then

a terrible piece of inductive

right? This is a very good piece
